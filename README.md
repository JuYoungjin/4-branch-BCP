# 4-branch-BCP

These files contain

1. The calculator of 4-branch BCP 
(Because the size of tables that are used to calculate 4-branch BCP is too huge, I upload codes for making tables in the "make table" folder)

2. The generator of the CNF for finding boomerang characteristic of CHAM and LEA by considering the 4-branch BCP
